# WebPage-Project
For this project I created the foundation for my future website for my artist account and works of art. 
This project gives insight into who I am as a creator and ultimately as a person.
You will be able to take a glimpse at some of my skill sets and some past projects that I have worked on.
This webpage is only the start of a full fledged website that I will create once I develop more web development skills.
I always wanted to create my own website from scratch and so I was happy that I took this first step into creating my own platform.
